# Mini Compiler Project
### Overview
The **Mini Compiler** is a simple tool that performs lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis for a subset of programming language syntax, specifically **Java**. It validates code input, breaks it down into tokens, checks for syntactic correctness, and ensures semantic validity. This was developed as our final project for the course **Theory of Programming Languages**.
### Features
- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes the input code into data types, identifiers, operators, values, and delimiters.
- **Syntax Analysis**: Validates the sequence of tokens to ensure proper code structure.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Ensures the meaning of the code is correct by checking variable declarations, type consistency, and more.
